This project enagaged in data cleaning and exploratory analysis of DonoDeclutter dataset. DonoDeclutter is a decluttering app that allows people to donate their items that are no longer in use and also help connect sellers to buyers vice versa.
In this project we used pandas for data wrangling and manipuation, numpy for creating arrays, seaborn and matplotlib for data visualization for better understanding of the dataset.
